> A dashboard that displays real-time statistics about my plants and their environment.

## ðŸŒ± Features
[Sprout](https://mirrorkey.dev/Sprout/) offers:
- Soil moisture charts for each plant connected to Sprout
- Environmental statistics about the plants' environment, including temperature, pressure, and light levels.
- A cute design :)

## âš¡ Technologies

#### Frontend
Sprout's frontend was written using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). The charts were made using [vue-echarts](https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts). The icons and overall design are original.

#### Backend
Sprout's business logic consists of [an API](https://github.com/mirrorkeydev/SproutServerless) implemented using AWS Lambda and Serverless that is periodically polled by the frontend. This API retrieves the necessary data from a MongoDB instance hosted on Atlas, does a small amount of processing to reduce the number of data points, and returns it to the frontend.

#### Data collection
The data collection is handled by [AzureSpherePlantMonitor](https://github.com/prototypicalpro/AzureSpherePlantMonitor), which is an [Azure Sphere MT3620](https://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/azure-sphere-starter-kits/) hooked up to [Chirp!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1965) soil moisture sensors. This setup is currently deployed in my room, where it continues to gather new data every 2 minutes and publish its findings to the MongoDB Atlas instance every 10 minutes.
